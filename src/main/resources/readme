Run TLA2B as a stand-alone translator for TLA+ modules:
1. Open a console and goto the directory containing the TLA2B.jar
   
2. Type into the console:
	java -jar TLA2B.jar MODULENAME
	
	where MODULENAME is absolute or relative path (regarding to the current directory) to the TLA+ module
	(the extension tla can be present or absent).
	e.g.: 	java -jar TLA2B.jar C:/Examples/test.tla
			java -jar TLA2B.jar Examples/test
	
	If you want to use the module together with a configuration file, the file has to be named as the module
	with the filename extension "cfg" and it has to be located in the same directory.
	

To integrate TLA2B into the ProB Animator and Modelchecker download ProB under section "Nightly Build" from
	http://www.stups.uni-duesseldorf.de/ProB/index.php5/Download
